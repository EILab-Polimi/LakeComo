# LakeComo
Simulation model of Lake Como that can be combined with the [Borg Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm](http://borgmoea.org/) or another MOEA implemented in the [MOEA Framework](http://moeaframework.org/) to design a set of Pareto optimal operating policies via [Evolutionary Multi-Objective Direct Policy Search](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/(ASCE)WR.1943-5452.0000570) policy design. 

Lake Como is a sub-alpine lake in the Italian lake district, northern Italy. It is the third-largest lake in Italy and reaches a maximum depth of 410 m, which makes it the fifth-deepest lake in Europe. The lake is shaped like an inverted 'Y' surrounded by mountains and primarily fed by the Adda River, which also serves as the only exit point of the lake. The lake catchment has an area of 4,733 km2, with approximately 90% in Italy and 10% in Switzerland. The hydrologic regime is snow-rainfall dominated, characterized by relatively dry winters and summers and high peaks of flow in spring and autumn, due to snowmelt and rainfall, respectively.
The Lake Como system involves numerous economic activities and has been actively studied since the 1980s. The existing regulation of the lake is driven by two primary, competing objectives: water supply mainly for irrigation, and flood control in the city of Como, which sits at the lowest point on the lake shoreline. These two objectives (both to be minimized) are formulated as follows:
* Flood control: the average annual number of flooding days in the simulation horizon.
* Water supply deficit: the daily average quadratic water deficit between lake releases and downstream water demands, subject to a minimum environmental flow constraint to ensure adequate environmental conditions in the Adda River.

To compile and run:
* Run `make` in the test folder to compile
* Run `./LakeComoSim settings_lakeComo.txt < u_test46.txt` to perform a simulation with a random policy

The simulation is performed using a 1 year trajectory of inflow data simulated by a hydrologic model; the observed inflow are from [Consorzio dell'Adda](http://www.addaconsorzio.it/). The operating policies use as input the day of the year, the lake level, and a perfect forecast of the cumulated inflows over the next 51 days (according to the results of [Denaro et al. 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0309170816304651)).
